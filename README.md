Sheafification
==============

Sheafification functor in type theory.

# Usage #
These files compile with the HoTT library https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT, commit 9b00d97c129d3810993e9f78f341d2074897f2e6.

One can use the library with
```
/path/to/coq_makefile -f _CoqProject -o Makefile
```
with adapted modification in _CoqProject, 
then simply compiling with `make` (this can take some time).
