Sheafification
==============

Sheafification functor in type theory.

# Usage #
These files compile with the HoTT library https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT, commit adc75f07419b07d11424842e61d72df668d95ee4 (19 Jan).

One can use the library with
```
/path/to/coq_makefile -f _CoqProject -o Makefile
```
with adapted modification in _CoqProject, 
then simply compiling with `make` (this can take some time (30 minutes
on a 2013 Macbook air, processor Intel Core I7 ; never finished on an
older computer)).
